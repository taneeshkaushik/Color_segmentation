How to run::
Just run the python notebook in any of the environments. 
Please check all the libraries used are available. 
An ouput folder is created when correct input paths etc. are provided. 

In the output the results are available, 
for each number of segments the folder is created where three images' 20 iterations have been shown.

Thanks
